### Part 1 - Personal Finance Planner
* The idea in this part of the task was to take all of the information you have for your savings, be they stocks, bonds, or crypto and see how much USD you have saved.

* I put together the crypto information to where the program can be easily run to get up to the minute crypto information pulling from the ticker whenever you ran the program. There were even several times the amount of USD the crypto was in changed when I was testing everything out and making sure it ran. 
* With the stocks I used Alpaca and my API Key to pull all the info I needed. Everything, like the crypto is set up for a "Plug and play" type syster. While I used 5/14/21 for my info you can get any days info you wanted by just switching out the date for what you need.
* Added a Chart to get an easy visual of what your savings look like, maybe you might want to switch to stocks over crypto? Or crypto over stocks? The pie chart gives you a good idea of how things look.
* Final thing gives you a solid look on the health of your financial situation.


### Part 2 - Retirement Planning
* Due to the fact that you don't know what the future is going to be the Retirement planning section of this homework is about using the Monte Carlo thing to get the best idea possible.
* You pull 5 years worth of data to get a frame of reference for the simulations you're about to run, you run the simulations, put it in charts to get a visual idea of where everything could end up. See the best and the worst
* For the optional stuff you just plan it for 5/10 years. Easy plug and play.
